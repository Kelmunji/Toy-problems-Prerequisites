# Week 1 JavaScript Practice

This repository contains solutions to the toy problems assigned in Week 1 of the JavaScript course. Each challenge is implemented as a separate JavaScript file, demonstrating basic programming concepts such as conditionals, functions, and user input handling.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

- **Description:** A function that prompts the user to input student marks (0-100) and returns the corresponding grade. 
- **Grades:**
  - A: 80 - 100
  - B: 60 - 79
  - C: 49 - 59
  - D: 40 - 48
  - E: Below 40
- **File:** `studentGradeGenerator.js`

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

- **Description:** A program that takes the speed of a car as input and calculates demerit points based on a speed limit of 70 km/h. 
  - If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
  - For every 5 km/h above 70, it adds one demerit point.
  - If the points exceed 12, the program prints "License suspended".
- **File:** `speedDetector.js`

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

- **Description:** A program that calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits.
  - It calculates gross salary, tax deductions, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
- **File:** `netSalaryCalculator.js`
